    "### The Technique\n",
    "I'm using a **Computer Vision** approach here, specifically **Histogram Difference**. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works\n",
    "1.  **Input**: Stream of frames.\n",
    "2.  **Extract**: For each frame, I calculate a color histogram. This basically summarizes the 'look' of the frame.\n",
    "3.  **Compare**: I check the difference between the current frame's histogram and the previous one.\n",
    "4.  **Decide**: If that difference spikes above a certain threshold, I flag it as a scene cut.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why I chose this\n",
    "I could have used a heavy deep learning model, but for detecting simple hard cuts, that's overkill. Histogram difference is fast, lightweight, and runs comfortably in the browser or on lower-end hardware, which matches AIVA's goal of being a snappy editor. It ignores small changes (like a person moving their hand) but catches big global changes (like the camera angle switching).\n"

    "\n",

    "    Imagine a transparent overlay that sits on top of Premiere Pro or DaVinci Resolve. It watches your timeline and gives real-time feedback:\n",

    "    *   *Jump Cut Spotter*: \"These two clips are too visually similar (30 degree rule violation). Zoom in 15% or find a reaction shot.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Multimodal 'Director' Controls**:\n",
    "    We need controls that work like a human conversation, offering high reliability (99%+ accuracy) which current gimmicky voice tools lack.\n",
    "    *   **Context-Aware Voice**: Instead of finding keyboard shortcuts, I should be able to say \"Zoom in on that face\" or \"Cut the silence here.\" This requires robust NLU (Natural Language Understanding) to map intent to complex macros.\n",
    "    *   **Precision Gestures**: Using the webcam to detect hand waves for undo/redo or pinch-to-zoom on the timeline without touching the mouse. This frees the editor from the 'keyboard hunch' posture.\n",

    "    Current tools crash if you try to render video and run AI simultaneously. AIVA proposes a **Split-Brain Architecture**:\n",
    "    *   **Dedicated NPU Usage**: Offloading the 'brain' (LLM/Vision models) strictly to the Neural Processing Unit or a reserved VRAM slice.\n",

Backend Setup (AI Engine)\n\nThe backend handles all heavy lifting, file processing, and AI inference.\n\n```bash\ncd backend\n\n# Create virtual environment (optional but recommended)\npython -m venv .venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate\n\n# Install dependencies\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\n# Start the API Server\npython start_backend.py\n```\n\n*Server runs on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)*\n\n### 2. Frontend Setup (Editor UI)\n\nThe frontend launches the Electron application window.\n\n```bash\ncd frontend\n\n# Install Node dependencies\nnpm install\n\n# Run the application\nnpm run electron\n```\n\n*Note: Ensure the backend is running before starting the frontend.*\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcc2 Project Structure\n\n```text\nAIVA/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 backend/            # Python FastAPI Server\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 audio/          # DSP & Cleaning Logic\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 vision/         # OpenCV & OCR Logic\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 voice/          # Whisper & Intent Parsing\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 api.py          # Main Endpoints\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 start_backend.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 frontend/           # React + Electron\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 src/            # UI Components & Logic\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 package.json\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 tailwind.config.cjs\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 README.md\n```\n",

    "# AIVA - AI Video Assistant & Editor\n\nAIVA is a next-generation, privacy-first video editing suite that combines a professional **3-pane Non-Linear Editor (NLE)** with powerful system-wide AI capabilities. Unlike cloud-based tools, AIVA runs advanced AI models **locally** on your machine, ensuring zero latency and complete privacy for your media.\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Key Features\n\n### \ud83c\udfac AI Video Intelligence\n\n* **Smart Scene Detection**: Automatically analyzes footage to detect cuts and scene changes using histogram correlation.\n* **Auto-Reframe (Smart Crop)**: Intelligently crops landscape (16:9) footage into vertical (9:16) formats, keeping the subject centered.\n* **Cinematic Grading**: automated color grading pipelines (e.g., Teal & Orange) to instantly improve footage aesthetics.\n* **AI Stabilization**: Algorithms to smooth out shaky handheld camera movements.\n* **Video Upscaling**: Feature-preserving upscaling to enhance low-resolution clips.\n\n### \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Advanced Audio Engineering\n\n* **Smart Silence Removal**: Automatically detects and strips \"dead air\" and pauses from voiceovers.\n* **Local Transcription**: Full offline speech-to-text using OpenAI's **Whisper** model.\n* **Audio Enhancement**: Professional high-pass filtering, normalization, and noise reduction.\n* **Voice Changer**: Real-time DSP effects to transform vocal characteristics.\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Multimodal Interaction\n\n* **Gesture Control**: Control playback and timeline operations using hand gestures (integrated via MediaPipe).\n* **Voice Command Interface**: Execute complex editing macros using natural language.\n* **Screen context**: Built-in OCR and screen capture to assist with workflows outside the editor.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Architecture\n\nAIVA uses a hybrid architecture to combine the performance of native Python handling with the reactivity of a modern web frontend.\n\n* **Frontend**: Electron + React + Vite + TailwindCSS.\n  * *Features*: Draggable 3-pane layout, MediaPipe gesture recognition, Lucide UI.\n* **Backend**: Python FastAPI.\n  * *Core*: OpenCV (Vision), Librosa/Scipy (Audio), FFmpeg (Rendering).\n* **Privacy**: All processing happens on `localhost`. No data is uploaded to the cloud.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udce6 Getting Started\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n* Python 3.10+\n* Node.js 18+\n* FFmpeg (Installed and added to PATH)\n\n### 1. Backend Setup (AI Engine)\n\nThe backend handles all heavy lifting, file processing, and AI inference.\n\n```bash\ncd backend\n\n# Create virtual environment (optional but recommended)\npython -m venv .venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate\n\n# Install dependencies\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\n# Start the API Server\npython start_backend.py\n```\n\n*Server runs on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)*\n\n### 2. Frontend Setup (Editor UI)\n\nThe frontend launches the Electron application window.\n\n```bash\ncd frontend\n\n# Install Node dependencies\nnpm install\n\n# Run the application\nnpm run electron\n```\n\n*Note: Ensure the backend is running before starting the frontend.*\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcc2 Project Structure\n\n```text\nAIVA/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 backend/            # Python FastAPI Server\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 audio/          # DSP & Cleaning Logic\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 vision/         # OpenCV & OCR Logic\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 voice/          # Whisper & Intent Parsing\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 api.py          # Main Endpoints\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 start_backend.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 frontend/           # React + Electron\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 src/            # UI Components & Logic\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 package.json\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 tailwind.config.cjs\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 README.md\n```\n",
